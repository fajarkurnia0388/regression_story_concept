# Regression - Project Documentation

## The Concept of Regression in Fiction

"Regression" in the context of stories or fiction is not a statistical term. Instead, this term refers to the concept of a protagonist returning to the past—whether to childhood, adolescence, or another point in their life—after facing death or tragic events.

### Characteristics of Regression in Fiction:

- **Time Travel**: Protagonist returns to the past with knowledge from the future
- **Second Chance**: Opportunity to fix mistakes or change destiny
- **Meta Regression**: Concept where the main character returns to the past with abilities or information from the future
- **Escape Limitations**: Overcoming limitations that exist in the original timeline

## Efficient Development Strategy

### 1. Continue Without Reverting

- Use `[continue without reverting]` to not lose code generation results from previous conversations
- Maintain context and progress that has been made
- Efficient for continuous development

### 2. Progress/Thinking Log

- Always create a progress or thinking log file
- Record what has been done or thought
- Helps the model understand context better
- Prevents loss of work results

### 3. Token Management

- This strategy does not count the number of requests for the thinking model
- Allows changing queries from simple to complex
- Example: Start with "what is 2+2?" then change to more complex queries

## How to Use

1. **Start with simple queries** to build context
2. **Use `[continue without reverting]`** when changing to complex queries
3. **Create log files** to record progress and thoughts
4. **Maintain context** with good documentation

## Important Notes

- This strategy enables "meta regression" in code development
- AI can use results from previous conversations
- Overcomes token/request limitations
- Improves development efficiency
